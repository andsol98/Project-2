# Project-2 Description 

                                                 Data Science Bot

This bot is designed to help the user analyze the 6,466 different posts provided to us on reddit. It starts off by asking the

user to enter a word or a phrase as an input, so that it can find all the posts with the related keywords and display the 

desired output. It then asks the user if he wants to further analyze any of the found posts if he/she desires. If yes, then it 

asks the user to input a number within the bound of the found comments, and will use that number to reveal the author of that 

post, 



the number of comments on that post and the score it recieved. If no, then the bot will simply terminate its function 

and simply thank the user for their time. Most importanly, the bot will continue to provide information as long as the user 

wishes to analyze the posts to his/her satisfaction.
